Welcome!

This is a game to teach you the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD, UNIX) terminal.

To start playing, open a terminal.

Type the letters "cd " (just the letters, not the quotes) into the terminal...

Then a space (press the spacebar)...

Then drag and drop the ``entrance`` directory from this folder into your terminal.

If your terminal asks you what you want to do with what you have just dragged into it, select "Paste location".
If it doesn't ask, then expect it to paste the file path of the folder you just dragged into it.

Once you have something like:

```
$ cd /home/your_username/Downloads/bashcrawl/entrance
```

in your terminal window, press RETURN.
The exact path to the entrance varies, depending on where you saved the file.

Your first move is very important.
Type this into your terminal:

```
cat scroll
```

You are now playing the game.
May the gods save you.
